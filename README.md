FINAL NOTES

All in all i feel like ive done well with the site and now have a greater understanding on html and cscs. I didnt use time over the weekend to go to the advanced site which im dissapointed about but i think for the first week i needed to take time away from the screen ready for javascript. Annoyingly i did mishear about timeframe on tuesday as i thought we had the whole day instead of just a half.

It was good to write a plan and have a structure before hand and to alot time frames for each thing i did.

going forward i think the main thing i would do differently is when having a problem to alot a time frame and if i dont get it just move onto something else so its not a manic rush at the end

questions to answer:
-user agent stylesheet?? why is it not picking up my css?
-clarify how to sewt up the page so its relative, 

-how to space blocks out so they are not overlapping/relative? it all fits on the smallest mobile ut as soon as you go to just before tablet it all changes, vh/rem/%?
